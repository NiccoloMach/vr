Hi!

Here's our shared repo.
The main [index.html](index.html) is the file we were editing together,

You can see it in action here: [https://vr.marpi.pl](https://vr.marpi.pl)

If you'd like me to add you to collaborators, you'll have access to your personal repo [public/](public/),
so you can test here: [https://vr.marpi.pl/public/](https://vr.marpi.pl/public/)

oh yeah, one more [thing](https://vr.marpi.pl/public/everyone) :)

Thanks everyone for coming!
